- Print game intro (which includes the programmer's name) and 
- ask the user for their name and greet them first.
- Also ask the user "What is the smallest number on the dice? ".
- Then ask the user "What is the largest number on the dice? ".
## Step 2: (10 pts) 
- Print out the result of the dice roll. "You rolled a 3 and a 5."
- Also, print out the results of the 6 basic math operations using these 2 random numbers.
- See the example program run output below.
